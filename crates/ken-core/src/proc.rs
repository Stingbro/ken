//! Child-process spawn hygiene.
//!
//! Ken shells out to `git` from several places (`sync`, `family_sync`, and
//! `src-tauri`'s family create/join helper). On Windows every one of those
//! spawns pops a console window for as long as the child lives — roughly a
//! second for `git remote`, which reads as flickering terminals when the
//! sync engine is doing its job. `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` suppresses it.
//!
//! This lives in its own module rather than in `sync.rs` because
//! `family_sync.rs` and the two downstream crates need it too, and none of
//! them should have to depend on the sync engine to spawn a quiet child.
