//! The first wiki, drafted from an analysis at set-up (knowledge-layer item
//! 4b). Offered, never forced: Claude reads the repos (briefs by section,
//! READMEs, build files, top docs, layout, imports, changelogs by version,
//! who has committed recently), and any folder of documents a person adds (a
//! Confluence export, say), and drafts the pages the templates README says
//! Ken drafts (Current, Conventions, Platform, Reference, the release notes),
//! a Repo Map page for every repo and an architecture page for every code
//! repo, and START-HERE's Traps rows, for a person to review. Every part of
//! every brief goes to one page; what the checkout says now (what the code
//! wires at start-up, the versions and data values) outranks a doc.
//!
//! Four rules keep it honest:
//! - A page a person wrote is never touched. A page is drafted only when it
//!   is missing or is still an untouched template (it has `{{…}}` left).
//! - Every drafted page is `status: draft` with no `verified:` date, so the
//!   age rule keeps raising it until someone reads it against its sources.
//! - Every page names the sources it came from, in its frontmatter and
//!   inline, as `repo:path` locators.
//! - Every repo path, code name and pinned version a drafted page states is
//!   checked against the checkout; a path with one match is rewritten in
//!   place, and a page with anything else wrong goes back once.
//!
//! The model call is passed in (`generate`), as for ingest.

        "You are drafting one page of a team's wiki, `{page}`, for a person to review. The page is: {purpose}.\n\n\
         Rules:\n\
         - Use only what the sources below say. Where they say nothing, leave the fact out: never write a row, a cell or a field that says something is unknown or not in the sources. Keep a template's table rows only where you have a source for the row's main column, and leave a cell empty when only it has none.\n\
         - End the page with one line, `To fill: …`, naming once what a person should add that the sources do not say. Before you name an item, look for its answer in the page's own frontmatter, in the sources below and in the pages of this wiki: name only what none of them answers, and never the `pin` (Ken writes it). Leave the line out when nothing is missing.\n\
         - Every statement cites its source. Each table row, list item and paragraph ends with the label of the source that says it, in backticks: `repo:FILE:line` at the line that says it when the source has lines (e.g. `ken:README.md:12`), else the source's label (e.g. `ken:README.md`); or a link, `[[Page]]`, when another page of the wiki owns the fact. In a table, the citations go in its source column (`shown in`, `evidence`, `sources`), else at the end of its last cell. A statement with no citation is taken out before the page is published, and every one is checked against what it cites.\n\
         - Write only what the cited source says: never a reason, purpose or consequence it does not give, and never a wider claim (\"all\", \"only\", \"every\", \"none\") than it makes. Give a list or set whole, as the source gives it; where a source gives only part of a set (\"the first 5 of 49\"), say so.\n\
         - Frontmatter: keep the template's keys; set `status: draft`; set `updated: {today}`; do NOT write a `verified:` line (a person verifies it later); list every source you used under `sources:` as its label.\n\
         - Plain words for a reader who has not seen the code. Tables where the template has them.\n\
         - A source labelled `(what this repo is for, in the team's words)` is the team's own description of that repo: use it to know what each repo is and how it is used.\n\
         - A source labelled `repo:FILE:line` is the part of FILE that starts at that line; cite it by that label.\n\
         - A source labelled `…:Repo-Map/<repo>.md` is Ken's own draft of that repo's page, a summary: cite the repo files it cites (its backticked `repo:path` labels), not the page.\n\
         - A fact another page of the wiki owns (the source `(pages of this wiki, and the facts each owns)`) gets a link to that page, `[[Page]]`, not a restatement.\n\
         - The checkout outranks a doc. Sources labelled `{REGISTERS}` and `{VALUES}`, and the build files, say what the code is now; a brief, README or note says what was true when it was written. Write a version, default, count, class, test, command or list of what is registered only as the checkout has it, and cite the file it is in.\n\
         - When a doc and the checkout disagree on something the checkout can answer (a value, a name, a command, a path, a setting), write the checkout's answer and cite it; do not write that the sources disagree. Ask a person to rule only where the checkout cannot settle it, in one line, on the one page that owns the fact.\n\
         - People: write an owner, a role or a decider only where CODEOWNERS, a `people/` file or a repo's own docs name one. Never write a role nobody stated. The recent contributors from git say who has committed lately, nothing more. Never speculate whether two names are one person.\n\
         - Reply with the finished page only, in Markdown, starting with `---`. No preamble, no code fences around it.\n\n"
