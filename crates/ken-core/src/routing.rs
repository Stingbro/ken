//! Workspace search routing (`openspec/changes/kg-routing`).
//!
//! Given a query, decide which member projects' semantic indexes to search
//! — directly when a member is named, via the workspace KG when it isn't,
//! broadcasting when neither applies — then fan out the existing per-member
//! hybrid search (`crate::search`) and merge the member result lists into
//! one cited list. This module is composition and policy only: no new
//! storage, no new retrieval algorithm (proposal.md, design.md "Goals /
//! Non-Goals").
//!
//! ## Scope of this session (ken-core layer, tasks 1.1-1.4)
//!
//! `plan_route` (task 1.1) is the three-tier decision (design D1: "a pure
//! function with the KG as optional input" — pure in the sense that its
//! only I/O is through the caller-injected `&WorkspaceKgDb` read handle,
//! which is exactly what makes it table-testable with an in-memory
//! fixture). `search_member`/`execute_plan`/`merge_routed` (task 1.3) are
//! the fan-out + cross-member RRF merge. `WorkspaceKgDb::rank_projects_for_entities`
//! (task 1.2) lives in `workspace_kg_db.rs`, additive next to the existing
//! `entity_links`/`doc_pointers` CRUD.
//!
//! ## Deviations from the design doc (recorded per this session's brief:
//! "deferral over invention; record conflicts")
//!
//! * **No `KgHandle` type.** `design.md`/`tasks.md` write `kg: Option<&KgHandle>`
//!   but no such type exists anywhere in the codebase. `workspace_kg_db.rs`
//!   already documents that the design's `workspace.rs` member-enumeration
//!   layer doesn't exist yet either. The concrete, already-real type that
//!   fits the slot is `&WorkspaceKgDb` itself (it has an `open_in_memory`
//!   test constructor, which is exactly what makes the KG a "soft
//!   dependency" fixture-testable per D1) — used directly rather than
//!   inventing a wrapper trait with a single implementor.
//! * **No `ProjectId` newtype.** Every existing member-identifying type in
//!   this crate (`federation::MemberSnapshot::project_id`,
//!   `federation::Member::project_id`, `entity_links.project_id`) uses a
//!   plain `Uuid` (a member's `ProjectConfig.id`). `RoutePlan::targets` does
//!   the same rather than introducing a newtype nothing else in the crate
//!   uses.
//! * **No alias field.** `proposal.md`'s Named tier says "name/alias
//!   containment", but `project::ProjectConfig` has only `name` — there is
//!   no aliases list anywhere in the codebase to read. Named-tier matching
//!   therefore matches `MemberInfo::name` only, normalized (so casing,
//!   punctuation, and whitespace variants of the same name still match —
//!   the closest available approximation of "alias-tolerant"). If a real
//!   alias list lands later, `MemberInfo` can grow a field without changing
//!   `plan_route`'s signature.
//! * **No production single-DB `hybrid_search` exists in ken-core to call.**
//!   Grepping for it turns up only a private test helper in `engine.rs`
//!   (`fn hybrid_search`, `#[cfg(test)]`) with a doc comment saying the real
//!   thing is "task 2.2's `hybrid_search` command" — which lives in
//!   `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, composing `Db::search_chunks_fts` +
//!   `Db::semantic_search` + `search::merge_and_rerank` itself. `search_member`
//!   below is that same composition, generalized to one member so this
//!   layer (and `ken-mcp`, later) can reuse it instead of re-deriving it a
//!   third time.
//! * **Concurrency is the caller's, not this module's.** `Db` wraps a plain
//!   `rusqlite::Connection`, which is `Send` but not `Sync` — there is no
//!   way to fan a read out across threads over a shared `&Db` the way
//!   `std::thread::scope` needs. ken-core's own precedent
//!   (`std::thread::spawn` in `engine.rs`/`chat.rs`/`watch.rs`/etc.) always
//!   pairs with an owned handle or channel, never a borrowed `!Sync` value
//!   shared across threads; src-tauri's actual multi-project concurrency
//!   wraps each project's `Db` in its own `Arc<Mutex<Db>>` and fans out via
//!   `spawn_blocking`/tokio tasks (see `hybrid_search` in
//!   `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`). Reproducing that here would mean either
//!   requiring every caller to pass `Arc<Mutex<Db>>` (a shape ken-core's
//!   `Db` API doesn't otherwise use) or spawning raw OS threads per search
//!   inside a "pure" module. Instead: `search_member` is the single-member,
//!   synchronous primitive; `execute_plan` composes it in a plain sequential
//!   loop over `plan.targets` (still "embed once, reuse the vector across
//!   members" — the loop just isn't parallel). A caller that wants real
//!   concurrency (src-tauri task 2.1, ken-mcp) calls `search_member` itself
//!   per target under its own thread/task pool and feeds the resulting
//!   [`MemberHits`] to [`merge_routed`], which is pure and has no opinion on
//!   how its inputs were produced. This is the "honest adaptation" the task
//!   brief allowed for.
//! * **KG breadcrumbs are plan-level, not per-hit.** `design.md` D3 shows
//!   `kg://<entity-id> → project` as an illustration of what a breadcrumb
//!   *explains*, not a literal stored string — precise per-hit entity
//!   attribution would need joining each hit's path back through
//!   `doc_pointers` by `(project_id, rel_path)`, which isn't available at
//!   this layer (a hit's path comes from the member's own `chunks` table,
//!   not from `doc_pointers`). `merge_routed` instead attaches every
//!   `RouteReason::KgEntities` id as a `kg://<id>` breadcrumb to every hit
//!   from that plan — correct ("these are the entities that caused this
//!   search to happen") even if not maximally precise ("this exact hit is
//!   about that exact entity"). The UI already owns final breadcrumb
//!   rendering (D3: "the UI resolves ... to open the source"), so it can
//!   compose `member name + these ids` however it likes.
