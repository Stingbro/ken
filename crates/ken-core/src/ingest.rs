//! The library inbox (Ways of Working, docs-system "Ingest"), in two parts.
//! An ingest runs as soon as a source is dropped in, and nobody confirms it.
//!
//! **Processing.** A source dropped in `Research/Ingestion/Raw/` is read and
//! written up as one dated note from `Templates/Ingested-note.md` (a
//! summary, the key takeaways, what it overturns, contradictions, rulings,
//! actions, escalations and next steps, as that kind of source needs),
//! straight into its organized home. What follows from it is written at once
//! and cites the note ([`follow_ups`]): page edits and new pages, ideas and
//! escalations in the team repo, and my next steps on Your day. Each write is
//! recorded on the source's card ([`Written`]) so a person can undo it.
//! Four things wait instead: a ruling, for its decider; a change to
//! Ways-of-Working, Conventions or a rule, as a ticket; an edit staging held
//! ([`rewrites_a_fifth`], or the page changed while the source was read);
//! and an action, as a ticket. The source stays in `Raw/` until it is seen,
//! and is not read again.
//!
//! **Filing.** When the person has read the card ([`file`]), the source
//! moves beside its note, under `Research/Ingestion/Ingested/<Meetings|
//! Recordings|Documents|Notes|Sessions>/<YYYY-MM>/`. [`undo_write`]
//! reverses one write; [`undo_all`] reverses every one, then the note and
//! the move.
//!
//! [`run_pass`] reads every new source in turn (a recording is transcribed
//! first); one that fails is recorded and passed over. The model call is
//! passed in (`generate`), so the app runs Claude headless and a test a
//! stand-in.
