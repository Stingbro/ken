/**
 * Content-proportional column widths for Markdown tables.
 *
 * A table in Ken never scrolls sideways: it is capped at the text column (or,
 * in full-width mode, at the pane's gutters) and its cells wrap. Getting that
 * guarantee out of CSS alone needs `overflow-wrap: anywhere` on the cells,
 * because only `anywhere` lets a single unbreakable token (a URL, an id) give
 * way instead of forcing the table wider than its cap.
 *
 * The price is that `anywhere` also collapses every column's *min-content*
 * width to about one character, and the browser's automatic table layout
 * sizes columns by interpolating between min-content and max-content. With
 * every floor at one character it ends up splitting the width almost evenly:
 * a `2026-09-17` column wrapped onto three lines while a prose column that
 * wanted 1100px was handed 100px. Proportion was exactly what got lost.
 *
 * So the widths are computed here instead, from each column's max-content
 * width — the width its longest cell (or its heading) would want on one line,
 * i.e. how much content the column holds — and written to a `<colgroup>` with
 * `table-layout: fixed`, which makes them exact. See `columnWidths` for the
 * rule.
 *
 * Widths are DOM-only: the `<colgroup>` sits outside ProseMirror's content
 * DOM and is never serialized, so the markdown round trip is untouched. They
 * are recomputed whenever a table's content changes and whenever the editor is
 * resized — but only for the tables that changed, because measuring forces the
 * browser to lay the document out again. See `TableMark` and
 * `layoutTableBlocks` for how little of that work a keystroke has to pay for.

 * in less; a default-width table shrinks to its content.
 *
 * Exported for unit tests.
 *
 * The rule, when the content does not all fit: protect as many of the
 * narrowest columns as the cap can afford, and let the rest absorb the
 * compression.
 *
 *   - Sort the columns by content and consider protecting the `k` narrowest,
 *     for every `k`: those get their *full* max-content width, and the
 *     remainder is split between the others by `weigh`.
 *   - A `k` is allowed only if every squeezed column still comes out at least
 *     as wide as the widest protected one. So a column is protected exactly
 *     when its whole content fits in the room a squeezed column gets anyway:
 *     no column is ever held wide at the expense of one with more in it.
 *   - Take the largest allowed `k`. Dates, counts, statuses and names are
 *     then rendered whole, and the description and notes columns — which
 *     re-wrap gracefully — give up the difference between them, by content.
 *
 * `k = 0` always qualifies, so there is always an answer; when the cap is
 * tight enough that nothing can be protected (fourteen columns in a 630px
 * pane, say) every column simply gets its weighted share. Either way no
 * column ends up under `MIN_COLUMN`, and mid-word breaking comes from the
 * cells' `overflow-wrap: anywhere`, so the table still does not scroll.
